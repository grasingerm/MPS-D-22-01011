# MPS-D-22-01011
Mathematica code for generating the data for the manuscript MPS-D-22-01011

The main file for generating the data and working through some of the algebra in MPS-D-22-01011 can be found in the file ``MPS-D-22-01011.nb``. The file ``network-model-schematics.nb``, along with the .csv files (which contain monomer coordinates), can be used to create some of the figures of the polymer network models found in the manuscript.
